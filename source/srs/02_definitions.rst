Definitions
===========

The definitions section contains any definitions needed to understand the SRS.
Often it will contain a glossary, defining terms which the reader may not be
familiar with (or which may have a specific meaning here that differs from
everyday use). This section may also contain definitions of any data files that
are used as input, a list of any databases which may be needed, and any other
organizational or workflow-related information that is needed to understand the
SRS.
